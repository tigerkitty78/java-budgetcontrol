oki so this is a budget management application .it is a financial tool developed using the Spring Boot framework and Java with Maven. This application enables users to manage their finances effectively by setting and tracking expense goals across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals. Users can define their spending limits, and the app calculates and displays the difference between actual spending and the set limits, providing this information as a percentage to help users easily understand their financial standing.

The app also integrates with email services using the Java Mail API and Gmail API. It can automatically access and read emails, recognizing electronic bills (e-bills). Postman was used in testing the endpoints . What i liked most about developing this was it requires a bit of logic and thinking since i had very specific features in mind. More to be added (investment and income handling and moree). And a pretty react frontend is to be added soon!
